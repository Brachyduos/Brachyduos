- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Brachyduos
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly here because i want to learn the gimmicks of how people communicate on GitHub
I'm looking through different platforms to see which one is the best to use to share projects efficiently :x
- ðŸ“« If you want to contact me, please look for Unitix, this is where i work and the dev team will do their thing, so they're the pros.
